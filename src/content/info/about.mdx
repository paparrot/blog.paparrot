# About Me

Hey there! Welcome to my blog.

Here, you'll find my life experiences, emotions, and opinions.

In 2022, life took a turn, and my family and I relocated to Montenegro from Russia, starting from scratch once more.
Something happened, we say.

This blog is mainly for foreigners who are curious about Russian culture and the everyday lives of its people, which I deeply admire.

Born in a small town in central Russia called Kirov, I spent my early years studying physics, mathematics, and Orthodox religion at school. Later, journalism became the focus of university studies in Saint Petersburg.

The journey included serving in the military (it's mandatory in Russia), working at McDonaldâ€™s, selling books, and waiting tables at fancy restaurants before finding a true passion in web development.

So, there are some stories for you. I hope you'll enjoy them, and maybe they'll make me, my friends, my family, and my country feel a little closer and attractive to you.

Have a wonderful day, my friends!
